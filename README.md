# VESC Express

The is the codebase for the VESC Express, which is a WiFi and Bluetooth-enabled logger and IO-board. At the moment it is tested and runs on the ESP32C3 and ESP32S3 but other ESP32 devices can be added.

## Toolchain

Instructions for how to set up the toolchain can be found here:
[https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32c3/get-started/linux-macos-setup.html)

**Note**  
ESP-IDF version 5.2 or later is required for building this project.

### Get Release 5.2.2

The instructions linked above will install the master branch of ESP-IDF. To install the stable release you can navigate to the installation directory and use the following commands:

```bash
git clone -b v5.2.2 --recursive https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf.git esp-idf-v5.2.2
cd esp-idf-v5.2.2/
./install.sh esp32c3 esp32s3
```

At the moment development is done using the stable 5.2.2-release.

## Building

Set the target chip/architecture with 
```bash
idf.py set-target <target> 
```

where target is esp32c3 or esp32s3. You will need to run a fullclean or remove the build directory when changing targets.

Once the toolchain is set up in the current path, the project can be built with

```bash
idf.py build
```

That will create vesc_express.bin in the build directory, which can be used with the bootloader in VESC Tool. If the ESP32c3 does not come with firmware preinstalled, the USB-port can be used for flashing firmware using the built-in bootloader. That also requires bootloader.bin and partition-table.bin which also can be found in the build directory. This can be done from VESC Tool or using idf.py.

All targets can be built with

```bash
python build_all.py
```

That will create all required firmware files under the build_output directory, with hardware names as child directories. All target switching is handled automatically with the build_all command.

### Custom Hardware Targets

If you wish to build the project with custom hardware config files you should add the hardware config files to the "**main/hwconf**" directory and use the HW_NAME build flag
```bash
idf.py build -DHW_NAME="VESC Express T"
```

**Note:** If you ever change the environment variables, or if when you first start using them, you need to first run `idf.py reconfigure` before building (with the environment variables still set of course!), as the build system unfortunately can't automatically detect this change. Running `idf.py fullclean` has the same effect as this forces cmake to rebuild the build configurations.
